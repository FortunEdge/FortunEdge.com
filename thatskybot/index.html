                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>Started in 2019 as I was getting into the game Sky: Children of the Light, I wanted a way to aggregate fan art in my Twitter (now known as X) feed. Twitter, of course already had ways to follow hashtags, but I was curious about the process for developing a bot and thought it would be a good way to contribute something that had potential to grow into somewhat of a fan hub with features that were in development at the time with the V2 Twitter API. The initial bot was created on the V1 API with Python and hosted on Heroku to simply retweet posts with related hashtags with the intention to rewrite to have a lot more interesting features to supplement the fan experience on Twitter.</p>
                <p>However, after Twitter changed ownership in 2022 and the team that was working on the API features I was banking on was removed, it became clear that bots were not part of the planned future of the platform, and my personal tastes were already drifting away from Twitter (by then renamed to X) when I shut down the bot for good in July 2023.</p>
